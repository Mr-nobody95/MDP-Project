Project Overview

This project implements and compares two fundamental Reinforcement Learning algorithms - **Value Iteration** and **Policy Iteration** - on a 32×32 Grid World environment using Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). The study includes comprehensive hyperparameter tuning, stability analysis, and statistical validation.

### Key Features
- ✅ Implementation of Value Iteration and Policy Iteration from scratch
- ✅ 32×32 Grid World with random rewards
- ✅ Comprehensive hyperparameter grid search
- ✅ Statistical stability analysis with 10 independent runs
- ✅ Visualization of convergence, paths, and performance metrics
- ✅ Detailed statistical comparison with confidence intervals
